# Networthy

A private, offline-first app for tracking your **net worth** — your assets minus your liabilities — organised into portfolios. Built with Flutter and Material 3, for **Android and iOS**.

> Your financial data is stored **encrypted on your device** and never leaves it, except when you deliberately export an encrypted backup.

## Features

- **Assets** — track stocks, mutual funds/ETFs, crypto, gold, cash, bank deposits, real estate, vehicles, bonds and more. Each asset type shows only the fields that make sense for it.
  - **Stocks / funds / crypto**: enter a ticker symbol, quantity and currency, and Networthy fetches the latest closing price to compute the holding's value automatically.
  - **Gold** and other quantity-based assets: enter a quantity and a price per unit.
  - **Cash, property, vehicles, …**: enter a single value.
- **Liabilities** — track loans, mortgages, credit cards, pending payments and taxes.
- **Net worth at a glance** — the home screen shows total assets, total liabilities and your net worth, converted into a single base currency. Assets and liabilities are grouped into **collapsible cards per category** (tap to expand for individual items; the collapsed card shows the category total).
- **Custom ordering** — long-press and drag to reorder category cards, or reorder items within a category (items stay within their own type). Your order is saved.
- **Portfolios** — create multiple portfolios (e.g. *Personal*, *Family*, *Business*), set a **default** that powers the home screen, and switch between them at any time. Each portfolio has its own net worth.
- **Statistics** — donut charts breaking down assets and liabilities by category, with per-slice percentages and totals in your base currency.
- **Multi-currency** — hold assets in any currency; Networthy converts everything into your chosen base currency using cached exchange rates.
- **Security & privacy**
  - The local database is encrypted with **SQLCipher (AES-256)**; the key is generated on-device and stored in the **Android Keystore** / **iOS Keychain**.
  - Optional **app lock** with biometrics or device PIN, re-locking whenever the app leaves the foreground.
  - Screenshot protection: `FLAG_SECURE` on Android, and a blur overlay in the iOS app switcher.
  - **Hide balances** hides every monetary amount behind `••••` with one tap.
- **Encrypted export / import** — back up selected portfolios (or all of them) to a password-protected file (AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256), and restore them on any device.
- **Adaptive Material 3 UI** — light/dark/system themes, **Material You** dynamic color on Android 12+, a bottom navigation bar on phones and a navigation rail on tablets and larger windows.

## Privacy

Networthy is **offline-first**. The only network calls it makes are:

1. **Stock/fund/crypto prices** — sends only the ticker symbol to a public finance endpoint.
2. **Exchange rates** — sends only a base currency code to a public, key-less rates endpoint.

No account, no analytics, no tracking. Your portfolio values, names and holdings are never transmitted.

Business logic lives in plain Dart (no Flutter imports) so it can be unit-tested with `dart test`.

## Building

Requirements:

- Flutter (stable channel, Dart SDK ≥ 3.13)
- Android: JDK 17 and the Android SDK (minSdk 26 / Android 8.0+)
- iOS: Xcode 15+ and CocoaPods (iOS 15+)

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run                 # debug on a connected device
flutter build apk           # Android
flutter build ipa           # iOS
```

The application id / bundle id is `com.cairnlabworks.mywealth` and the version is `1.0.0`.

## Quality checks

```bash
dart format .
flutter analyze
dart test                   # pure-Dart unit tests (96 tests)
```

The test suite covers the pieces where behaviour must be exact: currency formatting and rounding, net-worth and FX conversion, asset/liability form validation and entity mapping, category ordering, list labels, quote/FX response parsing, and — most importantly — the encrypted backup format, which is verified byte-for-byte against a file produced by the original Android implementation.

### Migrating from the Android (Kotlin) release

The Flutter app uses the same `MWB1` encrypted backup container as the Kotlin app, so backups exported from the old app import directly here. The on-disk database itself is *not* migrated in place: the SQLCipher passphrase is now stored through `flutter_secure_storage`, so an existing Kotlin database cannot be opened. **Export an encrypted backup from the old app and import it after installing this one.**

### Validation notes

`flutter analyze`, `dart format` and `dart test` all run clean in this repository. Widget tests (`flutter test`) and platform builds (`flutter build`) additionally require the prebuilt Flutter engine artifacts, which were not downloadable in the environment used for the migration; the UI layer is therefore verified by static analysis only.
